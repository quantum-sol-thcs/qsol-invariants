1. Purpose
This document provides a high‑level overview of the QSol Sovereign Knowledge System (SKS) architecture. It explains how constitutional artifacts, governance structures, protocols, definitions, enforcement mechanisms, and external engines interoperate to form a coherent, self‑governing institutional substrate.

The SKS is not software.
It is an institutional operating system.

2. Architectural Layers
The SKS is composed of six sovereign layers, each with a distinct role and boundary.

2.1 Constitutional Layer
Defines the foundational authority of the institution.

Includes:

Preamble

Constitution

Sovereign License

Council Charter

Access Control System

THCS (epistemic substrate)

This layer establishes:

identity

authority

rights

obligations

epistemic boundaries

It is immutable except through formal amendment.

2.2 Definition Layer
Defines the ontology of the SKS: the objects, invariants, and structures that the system recognizes.

Includes:

Canonical Time

SKO Definition

Invariant Set

Provenance Triplet

Multimodal Health Φ‑Object (MHΦO)

This layer answers:
“What exists inside the SKS?”

2.3 Governance Layer
Defines the human and institutional roles that operate the SKS.

Includes:

Roles

Council Procedures

Delegation Rules

This layer answers:
“Who may act, and under what authority?”

2.4 Enforcement Layer
Defines how rules are upheld and how violations are handled.

Includes:

License Enforcement

Access Control Enforcement

Privilege Events

This layer answers:
“What happens when rules are broken?”

2.5 Protocol Layer
Defines the operational procedures of the SKS.

Includes:

Build Protocol

Audit Protocol

Amendment Protocol

Lifecycle Transition

Migration

Decommissioning

Cryptographic Rotation

Meta‑Governance Invocation

Sovereign Boundary Reconciliation

High‑Security State Transition

Rollback

Catastrophic Recovery

Sovereign Continuity Guarantee

Epoch Transition

External Oracle Registration (P‑020)

This layer answers:
“How does the institution operate?”

2.6 Manifest Layer
Defines the structure of the corpus itself.

Includes:

SKS‑Root.manifest

SKS‑Constitution.manifest

SKS‑Definitions.manifest

SKS‑Governance.manifest

SKS‑Enforcement.manifest

SKS‑Protocols.manifest

SKS‑Full‑Corpus.manifest

This layer answers:
“What is the canonical structure of the SKS?”

3. External Engines and Implementations
The SKS is intentionally separate from implementation repositories.

3.1 The qsol-invariants Engine
This repository contains:

invariant evolution logic

quantum state containers

stability analysis

absolute limits

engineering doctrine

tests

It is not part of the sovereign corpus.
It is governed by the SKS, not merged into it.

The SKS defines the rules.
The engine implements them.

4. Multimodal Health Φ‑Objects
The MHΦO is the canonical representation of latent health state derived from multimodal physiological data.

It integrates:

fundus imaging

PPG waveforms

spirometry

and future modalities

MHΦOs are governed objects with:

identity

provenance

lineage

uncertainty

cross‑modal consistency

allowed‑use and prohibited‑use rules

They are produced by external oracles, which must be registered via Protocol P‑020.

5. External Oracle Registration
External ML models (e.g., REGLE, DeepNull, PPG‑CVD, retinal aging clocks) are not sovereign actors.

They are subordinate oracles.

Protocol P‑020 defines:

manifest structure

provenance requirements

governance constraints

evaluation cycles

disclaimers

permissible use

This ensures that all external computation is:

auditable

governed

identity‑bound

constitutionally compliant

6. Separation of Concerns
The SKS enforces strict separation between:

Sovereign Layer
law

governance

definitions

protocols

provenance

identity

Engine Layer
computation

simulation

invariant evolution

model execution

This separation ensures:

auditability

clarity

long‑term stability

institutional continuity

7. Summary
The SKS is a sovereign, self‑governing institutional architecture composed of:

a constitutional foundation

a definitional ontology

a governance framework

an enforcement system

a protocol suite

a manifest structure

external engines governed through formal interfaces
