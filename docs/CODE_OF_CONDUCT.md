Standards for Conduct, Collaboration, and Canonical Integrity
Version: 1.0
Status: Canonical
Governs: All contributors, maintainers, and participants in QSol.llc  repositories

1. Purpose
The QSOL Invariant Evolution Core is a public, standards‑grade repository.
To maintain clarity, stability, and long‑term integrity, all contributors and maintainers must follow this Code of Conduct.

This document ensures that collaboration remains:

respectful

professional

constructive

aligned with the QSOL Engineering Doctrine

focused on mathematical and architectural correctness

The goal is to protect the invariant canon and maintain a productive environment for all contributors.

2. Expected Behavior
All contributors are expected to:

Communicate with clarity, professionalism, and respect

Focus on technical correctness and canonical alignment

Provide constructive feedback grounded in the invariants and doctrine

Maintain a collaborative, audit‑friendly environment

Uphold determinism, reproducibility, and mathematical rigor

Follow the Contribution Guidelines and Maintainers Guide

Contributions should strengthen the canon, not complicate it.

3. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are not permitted:

Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments

Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior

Disruptive or intentionally unproductive discussion

Introducing complexity without justification

Proposing changes that violate the Absolute Limits Contract

Attempting to bypass deterministic or PHI‑bounded rules

Submitting code that introduces hidden state, randomness, or side effects

Ignoring or dismissing the QSOL Engineering Doctrine

Any behavior that undermines the clarity, stability, or integrity of the invariant canon is unacceptable.

4. Canonical Alignment Requirement
All contributions must align with:

the Absolute Limits Contract

the PHI‑bounded Evolution Law

the QSOL Engineering Doctrine

the SESSION_VALIDITY specification (for ZK components)

the Contribution Guidelines

the Maintainers Guide

Changes that alter or weaken these foundations require prior discussion and explicit approval.

5. Reporting Issues
If you observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

Open an issue describing the concern, or

Contact the maintainers privately if the matter is sensitive

Reports will be reviewed promptly, professionally, and confidentially.

6. Enforcement
Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

Requesting clarification or correction

Closing or rejecting pull requests

Temporarily or permanently restricting participation

Reverting non‑canonical changes

Enforcement decisions are final and guided by:

the QSOL Engineering Doctrine

the Maintainers Guide

the need to preserve canonical integrity

7. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to:

all contributions

all discussions

all issues and pull requests

all interactions within the QSOL ecosystem

all official QSol.llc  communication channels

8. License
By participating in this project, you agree that your contributions and interactions fall under the Apache License 2.0, consistent with the rest of the repository.
